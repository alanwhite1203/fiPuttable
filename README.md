# fiPuttable
A puttable bond is a bond in which the investor has the right to sell the bond back to the issuer at specified times for a specified price. At each puttable date prior to the bond maturity, the investor may get the investment money back by selling the bond back to the issuer. The underlying bonds can be fixed rate bonds or floating rate bonds. A puttable bond can therefore be considered a vanilla underlying bond with an embedded Bermudan style option. Puttable bonds protect investors. Therefore, a puttable bond normally pays investors a lower coupon than a non-callable bond.
